# Caternary_Simulation
This is a matlab scrip to simulate a caternary curve using gradient descent on spring-point system.

You can adjust the end points of the caternary by changing the inputs to simulate\_Cat.m inside the function update\_plot.m. The initial length can also be modified. It is 4 by default.
